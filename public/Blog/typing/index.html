          I'm a pretty proficient typer, but I've definitely noticed that some words are harder than others. Which begs
          the question, what makes some words hard to type, and what makes some words easy to type?
          <br><br>
          Intuitively, I think it's probably about the distribution
          of letters and more specifically where they are positioned on the keyboard. A naive answer might be something
          like, typing
          speed is proportional to the total distance between the letters.
          <br><br>
          But when I think about typing a bit more carefully, I've come to the conclusion that perhaps what's more
          important is the alternation of hands, because that's what allows typist to start really flowing between the
          characters. Double letters are probably
          a single finger needs to take on so much responsibilty (try typing "balloon" really fast, you'll notice your
          ring finger is noticebly overworked).
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>
          To answer this question, we need to do some data collection first!
        </p>
        <div id="p5canvas" style="margin: 50px 0px 50px 0px; border: 2px; border-style: solid;"> </div>
        <div class="note" style="top: 28%">The wordlist comes from
          <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000"
            style="text-decoration: none; color:beige; position: relative;">https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000</a>
        </div>
        <p>
          After doing this for about 30 minutes, I got some results that we can start to analyze.
        </p>
        <iframe style="width: 75vw; height: 60vh; overflow: hidden; margin: 3em;" scrolling="no"
          src="delay_histogram.html" seamless></iframe>
        <p>
          From the chart, we can see that most letters took me about ~55ms to type, and almost all of them are below
          200ms. As we might also expect, the frequencies also form a normal distribution with some outliers towards the
          right. (Note that in this graph, I have pruned datapoints that were more than 5 standard deviations above the
          mean which removed 139 datapoints)
          <br><br>
          Now considering the average time a pair of letters takes, we notice that some take much longer than others
          (looks like Zipf's distribution?). This begs the question, what causes some pairs to take more time than
          others?
        </p>

        <p>
          My first instinct is to look at the distances between letters on the keyboard, perhaps there is some way to
          correlate how far apart letters are with the time it takes to type them. Obviously this is a pretty crude
          approximation since we type with two hands (hopefully) so we don't really care about the absolute distances
          very much but it's worth taking a look at.
        </p>
        <iframe style="width: 75vw; height: 60vh; overflow: hidden; margin: 3em;" scrolling="no"
          src="time_dist_scatter.html"></iframe>
        <p>
          Well, seems like I was pretty wrong about that. In fact there is a <span style="font-weight: bold" ;> negative
          </span>correlation between distance and time to type. May this could be explained by the fact that letters
          that are far apart tend to be typed by different hands and therefore are actually faster not slower.
          <br>
          <br>
          To test this theory, we can count the number of times we have to switch hands when typing a word (normalized
          by length of word), and do the same analysis. If words that require more hand switching are quicker to type,
          that proves some supporting evidence my explaination.
        </p>

          src="word_switches.html"></iframe>
          <p>
            Well, not really. I'm starting to get bored of this so I'll come back to this some other day (maybe) and hopefully actually be able to get some cool results about typing.

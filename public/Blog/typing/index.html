                    I'm a pretty proficient typer, but I've definitely noticed that some words are harder than others. Which begs
                    the question, what makes some words hard to type, and what makes some words easy to type?
                    <br><br>
                    Intuitively, I think it's probably about the distribution
                    of letters and more specifically where they are positioned on the keyboard. A naive answer might be something like, typing
                    speed is proportional to the total distance between the letters.
                    <br><br>
                    But when I think about typing a bit more carefully, I've come to the conclusion that perhaps what's more
                    important is the alternation of hands, because that's what allows typist to start really flowing between the characters. Double letters are probably
                    a single finger needs to take on so much responsibilty (try typing "balloon" really fast, you'll notice your ring finger is noticebly overworked).

                    To answer this question, we need to do some data collection first!

                    After doing this for about 30 minutes, I got some results that we can start to analyze.

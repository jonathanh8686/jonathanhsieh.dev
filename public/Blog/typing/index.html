          I'm a pretty proficient typer, but I've definitely noticed that some words are harder than others. Which begs
          the question, what makes some words hard to type, and what makes some words easy to type?
          <br><br>
          Intuitively, I think it's probably about the distribution
          of letters and more specifically where they are positioned on the keyboard. A naive answer might be something
          like, typing
          speed is proportional to the total distance between the letters.
          <br><br>
          But when I think about typing a bit more carefully, I've come to the conclusion that perhaps what's more
          important is the alternation of hands, because that's what allows typist to start really flowing between the
          characters. Double letters are probably
          a single finger needs to take on so much responsibilty (try typing "balloon" really fast, you'll notice your
          ring finger is noticebly overworked).

          To answer this question, we need to do some data collection first!

        <div id="p5canvas" style="margin: 50px 0px 50px 0px; border: 2px; border-style: solid;"> </div>
        <div class="note" style="top: 28%">The wordlist comes from
          <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000"

        </div>
        <p>
          After doing this for about 30 minutes, I got some results that we can start to analyze.

          From the chart, we can see that most letters took me about ~55ms to type, and almost all of them are below 200ms. As we might also expect, the frequencies also form a normal distribution with some outliers towards the right. (Note that in this graph, I have pruned datapoints that were more than 5 standard deviations above the mean which removed 139 datapoints)
          <br><br>
          Also taking a look at the average times pairs of letters take reveals that
